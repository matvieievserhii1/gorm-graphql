The Grails Testing Support library provides support for writing concise expressive tests for Grails artifacts with simple easy to use traits and supporting classes. The use of Traits makes functionality woven into the test class at compile time, which allows developers to explicitly view and explore the code. In addition, the Grail Testing Support makes testing more IDE friendly so developers can take advantage of auto-completion and click through navigation.
