In this example the query is attempting to retrieve the details of a single speaker with an id of `1`.

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/graphql" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
     -d $'
{
 speaker(id: 1) {
   firstName
   lastName
   bio
 }
}'
----

and the api responds with:

----
{
  "data": {
    "speaker": {
      "firstName": "Jeff Scott",
      "lastName": "Brown",
      "bio": "Jeff is a co-founder of the Grails framework, and a core member of the Grails development team."
    }
  }
}
