=== Create

In this example the request is a mutation to create a speaker.

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/graphql" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
     -d $'
mutation {
  speakerCreate(speaker: {
    firstName: "James"
    lastName: "Kleeh"
  }) {
    id
    firstName
    lastName
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}'
----

The API answers with the properties we requested.

[source, json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "speakerCreate": {
      "id": 8,
      "firstName": "James",
      "lastName": "Kleeh",
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
----

NOTE: If there was a validation error during the create process, the `errors` property would be populated with the validation errors.
