In this example we are updating properties of a speaker.

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/graphql" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
     -d $'
mutation {
  speakerUpdate(id: 8, speaker: {
    bio: "James is a member of the Grails team at OCI"
  }) {
    id
    bio
    talks {
      id
      duration
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}'
----

and the server acknowledges the update:

[source, json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "speakerUpdate": {
      "id": 8,
      "bio": "James is a member of the Grails team at OCI"
      "talks": [
        {"id": 87, "duration": 60}
      ],
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
----

NOTE: If there was a validation error during the update process, the `errors` property would be populated with the validation errors.
