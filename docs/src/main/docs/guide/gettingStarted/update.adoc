In this example we are updating properties of a speaker.

:url: http://localhost:8080/graphql
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/examples/grails-docs-app/src/integration-test/groovy/demo/SpeakerIntegrationSpec.groovy[tags=updateCurlCommand]
----

and the server acknowledges the update:

[source, json]
----
include::{sourcedir}/examples/grails-docs-app/src/integration-test/groovy/demo/SpeakerIntegrationSpec.groovy[tags=updateResponse]
----


NOTE: If there was a validation error during the update process, the `errors` property would be populated with the validation errors.
