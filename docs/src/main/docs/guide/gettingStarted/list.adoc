In this example the query is demonstrating retrieving a list of speakers. Since the talks of the speaker are requested to be returned, the association will be eagerly fetched to make the process as efficient as possible.

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/graphql" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
     -d $'
{
 speakerList {
   id
   name
   talks {
     title
   }
 }
}'
----

which returns:

[source, json]

  "data": {
    "speakerList": [

        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeff Scott Brown",
