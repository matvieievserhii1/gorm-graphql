In this example we are deleting a speaker. None of the normal properties of a speaker are available, however a `success` property is available to let you know whether or not the operation was successful.

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/graphql" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
     -d $'
mutation {
  speakerDelete(id: 8) {
    success
  }
}'
----

and the server acknowledges the deletion:

[source, json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "speakerDelete": {
      "success": true
    }
  }
}
----
