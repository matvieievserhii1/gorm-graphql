It is the responsibility of the type manager to convert Java classes to GraphQL types used in the creation of the schema. All of the basic GORM types have corresponding converters registered in the default type manager. It may be necessary to register GraphQL types for classes used in your domain model.

NOTE: The type manager is designed to store GraphQL types for non GORM entities (simple types). If you encounter a link:{api}/org/grails/gorm/graphql/types/TypeNotFoundException.html[TypeNotFoundException], it is likely you will need to register a type for the missing class.

== Get The Manager

To register type converters, you need to get a reference to the link:{api}/org/grails/gorm/graphql/types/GraphQLTypeManager.html[GraphQLTypeManager]. If you are using the manager provided by default, how you access it will depend on whether you are using the plugin or standalone.

=== Standalone

When creating the schema, initialize it first. The default type manager will then be set.

[source,groovy]
----
import org.grails.gorm.graphql.Schema

Schema schema = ...
schema.initialize()
GraphQLTypeManager typeManager = schema.typeManager
...
schema.generate()
----

=== Plugin

For Grails applications it is recommended to reference the bean created by the plugin. The easiest way to do so is to register a bean post processor. The plugin has a class available to extend to make that easier.

[source,groovy]
.resources.groovy
----
myGraphQLCustomizer(MyGraphQLCustomizer)
----

[source,groovy]
.src/main/groovy/demo/MyGraphQLCustomizer.groovy
----
import org.grails.gorm.graphql.plugin.GraphQLPostProcessor

class MyGraphQLCustomizer extends GraphQLPostProcessor {

    @Override
    void doWith(GraphQLTypeManager typeManager) {
        ...
    }
}
----

TIP: If you need to customize more than 1 manager, only a single bean needs to be registered. There are `doWith` methods for all of the managers you may need to register object instances with.

== Register A Converter

Once you have access to the manager, registration of your own type is easy. In this example a type is being registered to handle a Mongo `ObjectId`. The type will be used to do conversion of arguments in GraphQL.

NOTE: This process only handles how an ObjectId will be created from either Java arguments, or arguments passed inline in the GraphQL query or mutation. For Grails applications, the process of rendering the ObjectID as json is handled by link:http://views.grails.org[JSON views]. To supply behavior for how an ObjectId is rendered, see the documentation for json views. For standalone projects, you are responsible for any conversions that may need to happen.

import graphql.schema.GraphQLScalarType
import org.bson.types.ObjectId
