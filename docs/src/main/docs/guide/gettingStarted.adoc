You can expose a domain class within the GraphQL API by adding:

[source, groovy]
----
static graphql = true
----

Imagine you are building an API for a Conference. A talk can be presented
by a single speaker. A speaker can have many talks within the conference.
A typical one-to-many relationship which in http://gorm.grails.org[GORM]
could be expressed with:

[source, groovy]
----
package demo

class Speaker {
    String firstName
    String lastName
    String name
    String email
    String bio
    static hasMany = [talks: Talk]

    static graphql = true // <1>

    static constraints = {
        lastName nullable: true
        email nullable: true, email: true
        bio nullable: true
    }

    static mapping = {
        bio type: 'text'
        name formula: 'concat(FIRST_NAME,\' \',LAST_NAME)'
    }
}
----

<1> it exposes this domain class to the GraphQL API

[source, groovy]
----
package demo

class Talk {
    String title
    int duration

    static belongsTo = [speaker: Speaker]
}
----

Adding the `graphql` property allows us inmediately to query our domain class with
a GraphQL query:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/graphql" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
     -d $'{
  speakerList {
    id
    name
  }
}'
----

which returns:

[source, json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "speakerList": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Jeff Scott Brown"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Graeme Rocher"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Paul King"
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Iván López"
      },
      {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Ryan Vanderwerf"
      },
      {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "Colin Harrington"
      },
      {
        "id": 7,
        "name": "Zachary Klein"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

TIP: GORM GraphQL plugin supports http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#derivedProperties[Derived Properties] as illustrated in the previous example; `name` is derived property which concatenates `firstName` and `lastName`
