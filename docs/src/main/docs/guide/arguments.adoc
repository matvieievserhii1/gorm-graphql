If the only thing we could do was traverse objects and their fields, GraphQL would already be a very useful language for data fetching. But when you add the ability to pass arguments to fields, things get much more interesting.

We can retrieve the details of the speaker with `id: 1`

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/graphql" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/graphql" \
     -d $'{
    speaker(id: 1) {
        id
        firstName
        lastName
        bio
    }
}'
----

and the api responds with:

----
{
  "data": {
    "speaker": {
      "id": 1,
      "firstName": "Jeff Scott",
      "lastName": "Brown",
      "bio": "Jeff is a co-founder of the Grails framework, and a core member of the Grails development team."
    }
  }
}
